## WHAT IS THW PROBLEM IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROJECT?

Before implementing the Bridge Pattern, the problem we faced was that if changes needed to be made to a CS studentâ€™s class, it would also affect the other files.

## SOLUTION

However, the Bridge Pattern helped solved the problem by decoupling the CSStudent and Classes interface as seen below. This way, we can independently make changes to one file without affecting the others.
